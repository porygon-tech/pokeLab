Pokemon battle-oriented research, correlation studies and more.

## RotoAdvisor
RotomDex add-on for teams optimisation. Type vulnerability detection, moveset recommendations...

## Correlation studies
¿Are steel types significantly more defensive than the other ones? ¿Are there any correlations between base stats among any group of mons? ¿Could a genealogy be built from these data?
## Genealogy
"genetic" distance from pokemon taking into account their typing, stats, moveset and more. From phenotype (stats, typing, etc), try to infer genomes.
## Generator
Generative adversarial network, which generates complete pokemon (and possibly complete evolutionary families), including sprites, moveset, base stats, etc.
